# Exercise  

By now, you should be confident about using the entire Markdown language. **Write your resume in Markdown.** Incorporate links, emphasize important text, and use any other formatting that you deem appropriate.  

A resume usually includes:  

* Your full name and at least two ways to contact you
* Your work history
* Your education  

When you have completed your resume, export an HTML copy and a PDF copy from the Markdown file. The Markdown editors MOU and MarkdownPad allow you to do this easily.  

Remember that everything you do in Learn.Modern Developer is consequential, and all assignments are used to solve some other purpose, via Simultaneity. Later, you will edit and beef up this same resume and add it to your Profile page.
